# 🩺 Pneumonia Detection Using CNN

This project is a deep learning-based system for detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray images. Built using TensorFlow and Keras, the CNN model effectively classifies images into "Pneumonia" or "Normal" categories. This tool can assist in medical diagnostics, especially in under-resourced environments.
